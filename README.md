## Introduction
This project is being done as part of the [Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893), a four month course that I am enrolled in.

We will use reinforcement learning to train an agent inside a [Unity-ML](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) environment.  We will be working in an environment similar to [Tennis](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#tennis).
